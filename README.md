## QLog Simple log parser

This project implements a simple log file parser. It is inspired in Quake III Arena log parser,
but could be extended for any log file kind.

It uses regex to extract patterns and count game's statistics .
It groups statistics by game and prints total kills, players and players kills, and also kills by weapons.

It does not report in JSON and could be an improvement.
